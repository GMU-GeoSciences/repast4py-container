# Repast4py Container
This project aims to create a vesioned docker container that can run Repast4py in a HPC environment. This would required:

  - A dockerfile showing build instructions
  - A docker image hosted in an online repository
  - The image must allow conversion to a Singularity container
  - The image must contain all the required libraries to allow agent basd modelling

The production environment is a combination of user computers (for testing) and a Slurm based HPC cluster for full runs.
